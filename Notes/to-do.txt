create your own wordlist file and don't use an online one.

1. keylogger should start working once firefox is open, and it shouldn't be working otherwise.

2. if firefox is open, start listening for keyboard inputs as words and compare the words to a hard-coded array with words that aren't allowed to be searched.

3. if a hit occurs, automatically close firefox. (maybe add something else to closing firefox, like activating cold turkey blocker?)
