NSSM will be used to automate the script.

python script doesn't have to be a .bat file .

create your own wordlist file and don't use an online one.

1. keylogger should start working once firefox is open, and it shouldn't be working otherwise.âœ…
2. write key logs to a file
3. if firefox is open, start listening for keyboard inputs as words and compare the words to a hard-coded array of words that aren't allowed to be searched.
4. if a hit occurs, automatically close firefox. (maybe add something else to closing firefox, like activating cold turkey blocker?)
5. script should also be able to handle long search queries that contain the unauthorized words.For example,
if one the unauthorized words is mario, then the script should close firefox once the user searches for "super mario maker nintendo".So,
script should check if any, or if all, the unauthorized words are searched for. If they are, firefox should close.
