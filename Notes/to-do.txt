1. keylogger should start working once firefox is open, and it shouldn't be working otherwise.(use pythonw maybe)

2. see if pythonw can automatically execute scripts in the background once I open the computer. If not, maybe use pyinstaller to activate pythonw?


NSSM will be used to automate the script.



python script doesn't have to be a .bat file .
