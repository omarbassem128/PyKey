1. keylogger should start working once firefox is open, and it shouldn't be working otherwise.(use pythonw maybe)

2. see if pythonw can automatically execute scripts in the background once I open the computer. If not, maybe use pyinstaller to activate pythonw?


NSSM will be used to automate the script.

to execute the script using NSSM, it probably has to be a .bat file . (will still research more)

maybe a create script that opens startpage search page automatically once firefox opens. (for testing how to work with NSSM)
