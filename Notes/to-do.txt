1. keylogger should start working once firefox is open, and it shouldn't be working otherwise.(use pythonw maybe)

2. see if pythonw can automatically execute scripts in the background once I open the computer. If not, maybe use pyinstaller to activate pythonw?

current thing to work on is to see how a script can automatically execute once computer opens and stops once computer shuts down. 
Only way working way I've found is using pyinstaller. However, pyinstaller is only used to execute python files, and to use pythonw we need to use the cmd to run a command
that will keep executing in the background.
