1. keylogger should start working once firefox is open, and it shouldn't be working otherwise. (this will work using AppOpener)

2. record keylogs in a log file and compare them with a list of possible search queries (not sure yet)

3. Once a search query is found, close firefox and prevent it from opening for an hour(work in progress)
