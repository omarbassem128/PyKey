script should start running once firefox is open. NSSM will handle this (probably)

code should handle requests once enter is pressed. Meaning,
script will analyze words in  each search query made. 


script should also be able to handle long search queries that contain the unauthorized words.For example,
if one the unauthorized words is mario, then the script should close firefox once the user searches for "super mario maker nintendo".So,
script should check if any, or if all, the unauthorized words are searched for. If they are, firefox should close.

Need to constantly get firefox's/browser's status while the listener is working, but how ?
maybe the way I've set up the keyboard listener is not correct.
