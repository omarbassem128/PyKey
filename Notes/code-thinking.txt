keylogger should start running once firefox is open, and stop once firefox closes. âœ…


There should be a boolean variable that checks the status of the log file (open or closed) so that the file doesn't keep on reopening for every keylog.
 
script should clear past logs of the log file each time firefox closes and then opens.
